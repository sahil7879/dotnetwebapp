Set Up `kubectl` for the Non-Root User (`ubuntu` User)**

When you initialize Kubernetes using `kubeadm`, it generates a `kubeconfig` file located at `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf` that contains the clusterâ€™s configuration and authentication information. By default, only the root user can access it.

You can copy this file and set appropriate permissions to allow the `ubuntu` user to access it.

Steps:

1. Switch to the Root User:

   If you're not already the `root` user, switch to the `root` user or use `sudo`:

   
   sudo -i
   

2. Create a `.kube` Directory for the `ubuntu` User:

   Create the Kubernetes config directory in the home directory of the `ubuntu` user:

   
   mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/.kube
   

3. Copy the `admin.conf` File to the Non-Root User's Directory:

   Copy the `admin.conf` file (which contains the Kubernetes cluster configuration) to the `.kube` directory of the `ubuntu` user:

   
   sudo cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf /home/ubuntu/.kube/config
   

4. Change Ownership of the Config File:

   Change the ownership of the `.kube/config` file so that the `ubuntu` user can read it:

   
   sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/.kube/config
   

5. **Set Permissions for the Config File:**

   Ensure the permissions are correct for the `.kube/config` file:

   
   sudo chmod 600 /home/ubuntu/.kube/config
   

6. Switch Back to the `ubuntu` User:

   Now switch back to the `ubuntu` user to test the setup:

   
   su - ubuntu
   

7. **Verify kubectl Works for the Non-Root User:**

   Run a Kubernetes command to verify that the non-root user can interact with the cluster:

   
   kubectl get nodes
   

   You should now be able to see the nodes in the cluster.
